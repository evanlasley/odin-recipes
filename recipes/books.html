    <h4>Did you know that you can eat books, too, in addition to food-stuff, with your mind-brain-soul?! Crazy, right! Did you know that the advertising industry uses algorithms to subordinate the human soul to Baal and sacrifice the children to his endless wheel of suffering? It's true! Fit for just about any party, fundraising event, holiday or after-dinner, pre-confessional exile from your native country, these delectable books offer the perfect balance of sanity and madness for a world. Don't forget to overthrow Baal and tear down the Tower of Babel before it is too late!</h4>
